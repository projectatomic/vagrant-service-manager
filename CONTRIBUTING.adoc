== Submitting issues

You can submit issues with respect to the vagrant-service-manager plugin
https://github.com/projectatomic/vagrant-service-manager/issues/new[here].
Make sure you include all the relevant details pertaining the issue.

Before submitting a new issue, it is suggested to check the
https://github.com/projectatomic/vagrant-service-manager/issues[existing
issues] in order to avoid duplication. The vagrant-service-manager
plugin works closely with the
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/issues[Atomic
Developer Bundle] and the
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-utils/issues[adb-utils] RPM. You
may wish to review the issues in both these repositories as well.

== Submitting pull requests

=== Get Started

If you are just getting started with Git and GitHub there are a few
prerequisite steps.

* Make sure you have a https://github.com/signup/free[GitHub account].
* https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork] the
vagrant-service-manager repository. As discussed in the linked page,
this also includes:
** https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git[Setting up] your local
git install.
** Cloning your fork.

=== Create a topic branch

Create a
http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows#Topic-Branches[topic
branch] on which you will work. The convention is to name the branch
using the issue key you are working on. If there is not already an issue
covering the work you want to do, create one (see
link:#submitting-issues[submitting issues]). Assuming for example you
will be working from the master branch and working on the GitHub issue
123 : `git checkout -b fix-123 master`

=== Code

Do your work! Refer to the link:README.adoc#development[development]
section in the link:README.adoc[README] to get started.

=== Commit

* Make commits of logical units.
* Be sure to use the GitHub issue key in the commit message, eg `Fix #123 ...`.
* Make sure your code conforms to the coding style
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Make sure you have added appropriate documentation updates.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

=== Submit

* Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Initiate a https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/[pull
request].
* All changes need at least 2 ACKs from maintainers before they will be
merged. If the author of the PR is a maintainer, their submission is
considered to be the first ACK. Therefore, pull requests from
maintainers only need one additional ACK. By "2 ACKs" we mean that two
maintainers must acknowledge that the change is a good one.

== Merging pull requests

A project maintainer will merge the pull request. He should avoid using
the GitHub UI for the merge and prefer merges over the the command line
to avoid merge commits and to keep a linear commit history. Here is an
example work-flow assuming issue 123 from above:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Create a local branch for the pull request
$ git checkout -b fix-123 master

# Pull the changes
$ git pull <remote of the pull request> fix-123

# If necessary rebase changes on master to ensure we have a fast forward.
$ git rebase -i master

# If required, update CHANGELOG.md in the unreleased section. Commit!

# Merge changes into master
$ git checkout master
$ git merge fix-123

# Push to origin
$ git push origin master
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Releasing

* Make sure the HEAD of development builds and passes all tests:
  `bundle exec rake clean rubocop test features install`. You can also
  verify against https://ci.centos.org/job/vagrant-service-manager[CI]
* Review https://github.com/projectatomic/vagrant-service-manager/milestones[milestone] for the current release
** Make sure all issues are resolved
** Move unresolved issues into an upcoming release
** Close milestone
* Update the link:CHANGELOG.adoc[CHANGELOG]
* Update link:lib/vagrant-service-manager/version.rb[version.rb] with the correct
  release version. Consider http://semver.org/:[Semantic Versioning] guidelines
  when deciding on the release version
* Commit _CHANGELOG_ and _version.rb_ using commit message of the form:
  `vagrant-service-manager version=<version>`
* Push commit to upstream
* Release the gem: `bundle exec rake release`
* Create a Github https://github.com/projectatomic/vagrant-service-manager/releases[release] and paste change log for release
* Update link:lib/vagrant-service-manager/version.rb[version.rb] with the next anticipated release version, eg _1.42.0.dev_
* Commit with message: `vagrant-service-manager setting dev version <version>.dev`
* Push upstream
