:toc-placement!:

The vagrant-service-manager plugin is designed to enable
easier access to the features and services provided by the
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle[Atomic
Developer Bundle (ADB)]. It provides setup information, including
environment variables and certificates, required to access services
provided by the ADB and is a must have for most ADB users. +
 +
This plugin makes it easier to use the ADB with host-based tools such as
Eclipse and the docker and kubernetes CLI commands. Details on how to
use ADB with this plugin can be found in the
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/docs/using.rst[ADB
Documentation].

The vagrant-service-manager plugin is distributed as both a Ruby Gem and via RPM using the
Fedora COPR system.

=== Installing from RubyGems

The vagrant-service-manager
https://rubygems.org/gems/vagrant-service-manager[gem] is available on
https://rubygems.org[RubyGems] and can be installed via the standard
Vagrant plugin installation method:

------------------------------------------------
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-service-manager
------------------------------------------------

=== Installing from RPM

The
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/nshaikh/vagrant-service-manager/builds/[Copr
build] is accessible via the standard COPR access/install method:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ dnf copr enable nshaikh/vagrant-service-manager
$ dnf --enablerepo=nshaikh-vagrant-service-manager install vagrant-service-manager
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Usage

=== Example execution of the plugin

1.  Install vagrant-service-manager plugin:
+
----------------------------------------------
vagrant plugin install vagrant-service-manager
----------------------------------------------
1.  Download the relevant Vagrantfile for your
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle[ADB]
vagrant box, from the
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/tree/master/components/centos[repository].
For further details on the usage of custom Vagrantfiles designed for
specific use cases, refer to the
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/docs/using.rst[Usage
Documentation].
1.  Start the ADB vagrant box using `vagrant up`. For detailed
instructions consult the
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/docs/installing.rst[Installation
Documentation].
+
NOTE: When the vagrant-service-manager plugin is loaded and an ADB box is
started using the VirtualBox provider, the user needs to add a routable
non NAT network interface declaration in the Vagrantfile. If the user
does not provide a network declaration in the Vagrantfile, a private
DHCP network is added by default and a warning is displayed.

1.  Run the plugin to get environment variables and certificates:
+
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ vagrant service-manager env docker
# Set the following environment variables to enable access to the
# docker daemon running inside of the vagrant virtual machine:
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.28.128.182:2376
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/foo/bar/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/docker
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
export DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.20

# run following command to configure your shell:
# eval "$(vagrant service-manager env docker)"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
NOTE: The required TLS certificates are copied to the host machine at
the time of `vagrant up` itself. Every run of
`vagrant service-manager env docker` checks for the validity of the
certificates on the host machine by matching the certificates inside the
VM. If the certificates on the host machine are invalid, this command
will also re-download the certificates onto the host machine.

=== Available commands

The following section lists the high level commands available for the plugin,
which enable you to:

- set up your environment variables and get the TLS certificates to secure the
Docker communication channel;
- identify the routable ip address as well as the version of your VM;
- and manage the lifecycle of the configured services.

For a detailed list of all available commands and their explanations refer
 to the <<Commands.adoc#, Commands Document>>.

.  `vagrant service-manager [command] [--help | -h]` +
Displays the possible commands, options and other relevant information
for the vagrant-service-manager plugin.

.  `vagrant service-manager env [service] [--script-readable]` +
Displays connection information for all active services in the VM, in a
manner that can be evaluated in a shell.

.  `vagrant service-manager box [command] [--script-readable]` +
Displays VM related information like release version, IP, etc.

.  `vagrant service-manager [operation] [service]` +
Manages the life cycle of a service.

. `vagrant service-manager install-cli [service] [--cli-version] [--path]` +
Installs the client binary for the specified service.

[[debug-flag]]
==== Debug Flag

Append `--debug` flag to enable debug mode.

NOTE: Debug output from `vagrant-service-manager` is prepended with
the following string:
`DEBUG command: [ service-manager: <command name / log message> ]`

=== Exit codes

The following table lists the plugin's exit codes and their meaning:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Exit Code Number |Meaning
|`0` |No error

|`1` |Catch all for general errors / Wrong sub-command or option given

|`3` |Vagrant box is not running and should be running for this command
to succeed

|`126` |A service inside the box is not running / Command invoked cannot
execute
|=======================================================================

=== IP address detection

There is no standardized way of detecting Vagrant box IP addresses. This
code uses the last IPv4 address available from the set of configured
addresses that are _up_. i.e. if eth0, eth1, and eth2 are all up and
have IPv4 addresses, the address on eth2 is used.

== Development

=== Setup

1. After cloning the repository, install the http://bundler.io/[Bundler]
gem:
+
---------------------
$ gem install bundler
---------------------

1. Then setup your project dependencies:
+
----------------
$ bundle install
----------------

1. The build is driven via `rake`. All build related tasks should be executed
in the Bundler environment, e.g. `bundle exec rake clean`. You can get a
list of available Rake tasks via:
+
---------------------
$ bundle exec rake -T
---------------------

=== Code style

As most other open-source projects, vagrant-service-manager has a set of conventions
about how to write code for it. It follows the
https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide[Ruby Style Guide].

You can verify that your changes adhere to this style using the
 http://batsov.com/rubocop[RuboCop] Rake task:

--------------------------
$ bundle exec rake rubocop
--------------------------

=== Unit tests

The source contains a set of http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/minitest/rdoc/MiniTest.html[Minitest]
unit tests. They can be run as follows:

To run the entire test suite:

------------------------
$ bundle exec rake test
------------------------

To run a single test:

-------------------------------------------------
$ bundle exec rake test TEST=<path to test file>
-------------------------------------------------

=== Acceptance tests

The source also contains a set of https://cucumber.io/[Cucumber]
acceptance tests. They can be run via:

---------------------------
$ bundle exec rake features
---------------------------

NOTE: This Cucumber tests do not run on Windows, pending resolution of
https://github.com/projectatomic/vagrant-service-manager/issues/213[Issue #213].

Per default, only the scenarios for ADB in combination with the
VirtualBox provider are run. However, you can also run the tests against CDK
and/or use the Libvirt provider using the environment variables _BOX_
and _PROVIDER_ respectively:

-----------------------------------------------------
# Run tests against CDK using Libvirt
$ bundle exec rake features BOX=cdk PROVIDER=libvirt

# Run against ADB and CDK (boxes are comma separated)
$ bundle exec rake features BOX=cdk,adb

# Run against ADB and CDK using VirtualBox and Libvirt
$ bundle exec rake features BOX=cdk,adb PROVIDER=libvirt,virtualbox
-----------------------------------------------------

The _features_ task will transparently download the required Vagrant
boxes and cache them in _.boxes_. The cache can be cleared
via the _clean_boxes_ task.

Using the variable _NIGHTLY=true_ you can make sure that the
latest nightly build of the CDK is used (VPN access required).
Per default the latest public release of the CDK is used.

You can also run a single feature specifying the explicit feature file
to use:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ bundle exec rake features FEATURE=features/<feature-filename>.feature
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After test execution, the Cucumber test reports can be found under
_build/features_report.html_. They can also be opened via:

---------------------------------------
$ bundle exec rake features:open_report
---------------------------------------
