:toc-placement!:

The vagrant-service-manager plugin is designed to enable
easier access to the features and services provided by the
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle[Atomic
Developer Bundle (ADB)]. It provides setup information, including
environment variables and certificates, required to access services
provided by the ADB and is a must have for most ADB users. +
 +
This plugin makes it easier to use the ADB with host-based tools such as
Eclipse and the docker and kubernetes CLI commands. Details on how to
use ADB with this plugin can be found in the
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/docs/using.rst[ADB
Documentation].

The vagrant-service-manager
https://rubygems.org/gems/vagrant-service-manager[gem] is available on
https://rubygems.org[RubyGems] and can be installed via the standard
Vagrant plugin installation method:

------------------------------------------------
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-service-manager
------------------------------------------------

$ dnf --enablerepo=nshaikh-vagrant-service-manager install vagrant-service-manager
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Usage

=== Example execution of the plugin

1.  Install vagrant-service-manager plugin:
+
----------------------------------------------
vagrant plugin install vagrant-service-manager
----------------------------------------------
1.  Download the relevant Vagrantfile for your
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle[ADB]
vagrant box, from the
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/tree/master/components/centos[repository].
For further details on the usage of custom Vagrantfiles designed for
specific use cases, refer to the
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/docs/using.rst[Usage
Documentation].
1.  Start the ADB vagrant box using `vagrant up`. For detailed
instructions consult the
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/docs/installing.rst[Installation
Documentation].
+
*Note:* When the vagrant-service-manager plugin is loaded and an ADB box is
started using the VirtualBox provider, the user needs to add a routable
non NAT network interface declaration in the Vagrantfile. If the user
does not provide a network declaration in the Vagrantfile, a private
DHCP network is added by default and a warning is displayed.

1.  Run the plugin to get environment variables and certificates:
+
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ vagrant service-manager env docker
# Set the following environment variables to enable access to the
# docker daemon running inside of the vagrant virtual machine:
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.28.128.182:2376
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/foo/bar/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/docker
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
export DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.20

# run following command to configure your shell:
# eval "$(vagrant service-manager env docker)"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
*Note:* The required TLS certificates are copied to the host machine at
the time of `vagrant up` itself. Every run of
`vagrant service-manager env docker` checks for the validity of the
certificates on the host machine by matching the certificates inside the
box. If the certificates on the host machine are invalid, this command
will also re-download the certificates onto the host machine.

=== Available commands

The following section lists the available commands for the plugin and
their explanation:

1.  `vagrant service-manager [command] [--help | -h]`
+
Displays the possible commands, options and other relevant information
for the vagrant-service-manager plugin. If a `command` is specified,
only the help relevant to that command is displayed.

1.  `vagrant service-manager env [service] [--script-readable]`
+
Displays connection information for all active services in the box in a
manner that can be evaluated in a shell. +
If a `service` is specified, only the information for that service is displayed.
The supported services are: Docker, OpenShift. +
When `--script-readable` is specified the output is in `key=value` format. +
In the case of the _docker_ service, the required TLS certificates for securing the Docker
communication will be regenerated and copied to the host as part of the command execution.
If existing certificates are found to be invalid, they get regenerated.

1.  `vagrant service-manager box [command] [--script-readable]`
+
Displays box related information like release version, IP etc.
+
--
The possible options for `command` are:

* `version`: Displays the version and release information of the running VM.
* `ip`: Displays the routable IP address of the running VM.
+
--
When `--script-readable` is specified the output is in `key=value` format.

1.  `vagrant service-manager [operation] [service]`
+
Manages the life cycle of a service.
+
--
The possible options for `operation` are:

  * `status`: Lists services and their running state. If a `service` is specified only
the status of that service is displayed. If no service is provided then
only supported orchestrators are reported.
  * `start`: Start the given service in the box.
  * `stop`: Stop the given service in the box.
  * `restart`: Restart the given service in the box.
+
--
The supported options for `service` are: Docker, OpenShift.



[[debug-flag]]
==== Debug Flag

Append `--debug` flag to enable debug mode.

*Note:* Debug output from `vagrant-service-manager` is prepended with
the following string:

`DEBUG command: [ service-manager: <command name / log message> ]`

=== Exit codes

The following table lists the plugin's exit codes and their meaning:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Exit Code Number |Meaning
|`0` |No error

|`1` |Catch all for general errors / Wrong sub-command or option given

|`3` |Vagrant box is not running and should be running for this command
to succeed

|`126` |A service inside the box is not running / Command invoked cannot
execute
|=======================================================================

=== IP address detection

There is no standardized way of detecting Vagrant box IP addresses. This
code uses the last IPv4 address available from the set of configured
addresses that are _up_. i.e. if eth0, eth1, and eth2 are all up and
have IPv4 addresses, the address on eth2 is used.

== Development

=== Setup

1. After cloning the repository, install the http://bundler.io/[Bundler]
gem:
+
---------------------
$ gem install bundler
---------------------

1. Then setup your project dependencies:
+
----------------
$ bundle install
----------------

1. The build is driven via `rake`. All build related tasks should be executed
in the Bundler environment, e.g. `bundle exec rake clean`. You can get a
list of available Rake tasks via:
+
---------------------
$ bundle exec rake -T
---------------------

=== Acceptance tests

The source also contains a set of https://cucumber.io/[Cucumber]
acceptance tests. They can be run via:

---------------------------
$ bundle exec rake features
---------------------------

*Note:* These tests can be executed in Linux. Not all of the tests run
appropriately in Windows, pending resolution of
https://github.com/projectatomic/vagrant-service-manager/issues/213[Issue #213].

The tests assume that the ADB and CDK box files are available under
_build/boxes/adb-<provider>.box_ and
_build/boxes/cdk-<provider>.box_ respectively. You can either copy the box files
manually or use the _get_adb_ and _get_cdk_ Rake tasks, respectively.

Per default, only the scenarios for ADB in combination with the
VirtualBox provider are run. However, you can also run the tests against CDK
and/or use the Libvirt provider using the environment variables _BOX_
and _PROVIDER_ respectively:

-----------------------------------------------------
# Run tests against CDK using Libvirt
$ bundle exec rake features BOX=cdk PROVIDER=libvirt

# Run against ADB and CDK (boxes are comma separated)
$ bundle exec rake features BOX=cdk,adb
-----------------------------------------------------

You can also run a single feature specifying the explicit feature file
to use:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ bundle exec rake features FEATURE=features/<feature-filename>.feature
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After test execution, the Cucumber test reports can be found under
_build/features_report.html_. They can also be opened via:

---------------------------------------
$ bundle exec rake features:open_report
---------------------------------------
