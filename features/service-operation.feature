Feature: Command output from service operations like stop/start/restart
  service-manager should return the correct exit code from stop/start/restart command

  Scenario Outline: Boot and execute service operations like stop/start/restart
    Given box is <box>
    And provider is <provider>
    And a file named "Vagrantfile" with:
    """

      config.vm.synced_folder '.', '/vagrant', disabled: true
      config.servicemanager.services = 'docker'
    end

    When I successfully run `bundle exec vagrant up --provider <provider>`
